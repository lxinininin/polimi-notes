# Kruskal's Algorithm



# Optimality Check

Without applying any one of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, verify whether the following spanning tree is of minimum cost.

<img src="assets/image-20250104172244308.png" alt="image-20250104172244308" style="zoom:20%;" />

------

It suffices to verify that there exists a cost-decreasing edge. ==By inspection, we observe that, by adding edge {1,5} to the tree, the cycle ⟨1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1⟩ is introduced. In such a cycle, edge {4,3} has a strictly larger cost than {1,5}==

<img src="assets/image-20250104172950564.png" alt="image-20250104172950564" style="zoom:20%;" />

Therefore, by removing edge {4,3} and adding edge {1,5}, a spanning tree of strictly smaller total cost is obtained. It is shown in the following figure.

# Compact Storage of Similar Sequences

Consider the problem of storing a large set of strings, i.e., sequences of characters from a finite alphabet. We assume that the strings have many similar entries (they differ only in a small number of positions) and we wish to store them in a compact way. This problem arises in several contexts such as when storing DNA sequences, where the characters correspond to the four DNA bases. In this exercise, we consider the simplified version of the problem with only two characters.

Given a set of $k$ sequences of $M$ bits, we compute for each pair $i, j$, with $1 \leq i, j \leq k$, the Hamming distance between the sequences $i$ and $j$, i.e., the number of bits that need to be flipped in sequence $i$ to obtain sequence $j$. This function clearly satisfies the three usual properties of a distance: nonnegativity, symmetry, and triangle inequality.

Consider the following set of 6 sequences and the corresponding matrix $D = \{d_{ij}\}$ of Hamming distances.

<img src="assets/image-20250104174549048.png" alt="image-20250104174549048" style="zoom:20%;" />

* where, due to symmetry, only the upper triangle of the matrix is shown

In order to exploit redundancies between sequences and to save memory, we can store: 
1. One of the sequences, called the reference sequence, completely, and 
2. For every other sequence, only the set of bit flips that allow us to retrieve it either directly from the reference sequence or from another sequence.

Show how the problem of deciding which differences to memorize, so as to minimize the total number of bits used for storage, can be reduced to the problem of finding a minimum-cost spanning tree in an appropriate graph. Solve the problem for the given instance.

**Hint:** Given any two sequences (the $i$-th one and $j$-th one), how many bits are needed to store the positions in which they differ?

# Shortest Paths with Negative Costs & Ill-posedness

Given the following directed graph, find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, or show that the problem is ill-posed by exhibiting a circuit of total negative cost.

==Since the graph contains negative arc costs, we use **Floyd-Warshall's algorithm** that finds a shortest path between each pair of nodes, or establishes that the problem is ill-posed by exhibiting a circuit of negative cost.== The graph can contain cycles, but such cycles must be of nonnegative cost. It has complexity $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.

# An Application of Dynamic Programming to Machine Renewal

A company must buy a new machine and then determine a renewal (maintenance-replacement) plan for the next 5 years, making sure that, at any point in time, the available machine works properly. At the beginning of each year of the planning horizon, the company must decide whether to keep the old machine or to substitute it with a new machine.

The maintenance costs and the expected revenue (when the machine is sold) clearly depend on how old the machine is, and they are indicated in the following table:

| Years | Maintenance (kEuro) | Revenue When Sold (kEuro) |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 0     | 2                   | -                         |
| 1     | 4                   | 7                         |
| 2     | 5                   | 6                         |
| 3     | 9                   | 2                         |
| 4     | 12                  | 1                         |

To avoid high maintenance costs of an old machine, the machine can be sold at the beginning of the second, third, fourth, and fifth year, and a new one can be bought. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that a **new machine always costs 12K Euro**.

Show that the problem of determining a machine renewal plan of minimum total net cost (total cost for buying/rebuying the machine + maintenance costs - total revenue) can be solved via Dynamic Programming by finding a shortest path in an ad hoc directed acyclic graph. Find an optimal renewal plan. Is it unique?

==A shortest path (of cost 31) is $⟨(1,3), (3,5), (5,6)⟩$==. It amounts to buying a new machine every 2 years. Note that there are two other optimal solutions: path $⟨(1,2), (2,4), (4,6)⟩$ and path $⟨(1,3), (3,4), (4,6)⟩$.



# Project Planning

The preparation of the apple pie has long been a tradition at Rossi’s family. First the weight of the ingredients has to be determined: flour, sugar, butter, eggs, apples, cream. The butter must then be melted down, and added to a mixture of flour, sugar, and eggs. Apples must be added to this new mixture, once they have been peeled and cut into thin slices. The mixture can then be cooked, in the already heated oven. It is advisable to whip the cream only after the apple slices have been added to the mixture. Once the cake is cooked, the cream is used to garnish it.

The following table reports the time needed for each activity.

| Activity | Description                              | Time (minutes) |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| G        | Add apples to the mixture                | 4              |
| H        | Cook the mixture in the oven             | 40             |

A feasible flow of maximum value 30 can be found by applying the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We can start from the feasible flow $\underline{x}_0 = 0$ of value $\varphi_0 = 0$ and use the following augmenting paths:

- $\langle (s, m_3), (m_3, P_1), (P_1, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 6$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_1 = 6$,
- $\langle (s, m_2), (m_2, P_1), (P_1, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 2$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_2 = 8$,
- $\langle (s, m_1), (m_1, P_3), (P_3, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 6$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_3 = 14$,
- $\langle (s, m_2), (m_2, P_3), (P_3, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 6$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_4 = 20$,
- $\langle (s, m_4), (m_4, P_2), (P_2, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 6$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_5 = 26$.
- $\langle (s, m_3), (m_1, P_2), (P_2, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 2$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_6 = 28$,
- $\langle (s, m_3), (m_3, P_2), (P_2, t) \rangle$ with $\delta = 2$, yielding a feasible flow of value $\varphi_7 = 30$.

The resulting feasible flow $\underline{x}_7$ of value $\varphi_7 = 30$ is as follows:
